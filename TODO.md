### Soon
* handle page load, tab closed and other events
* add some GUI (zoom and rotation sliders, thickness & spacing, auto rotation)
* customize the visualization (transparency, view & draw mode, texture on/off)

### Next weeks
* context menu: "export as image"
* handle the CSS z-index of nodes
* render some nodes differently based on their positioning (absolute/relative)
* add details for each node (id, class, code bubble maybe?)

### Following months
* add some lights, experiment with bump mapping
* handle mouse clicks on the webpage and seamlessly refresh the visualization
* implement a map of the DOM (suggestions?)
* highlight a node and the children (glow, grayscale others, etc.)
* export the visualization to other browsers
* easter eggs
