### Soon
* alt/ctrl/cmd-click or right-click+drag = pan camera
* add some GUI (zoom and rotation sliders, thickness & spacing, auto rotation)
* customize the visualization (transparency, view & draw mode, texture on/off)
* zooming should be done towards the cursor
* preview pane (showing the visible area of the webpage, like a map)
* need a reset/close button
* about box (controls)

### Next weeks
* implement the MOZ_dom_element_texture WebGL extension once it's finished
* handle the CSS z-index of nodes
* render some nodes differently based on their positioning (absolute/relative)
* add details for each node (id, class, code bubble maybe?)
* implement a map of the DOM (tree structure, search, go to node)
* highlight a node and the children (glow, grayscale others, etc.)
* perhaps a zoom control that isolates a dom node and its children only
* hide/unhide nodes

### Following months
* add some lights, experiment with bump mapping
* handle mouse clicks on the webpage and seamlessly refresh the visualization
* export the visualization to other browsers (html, url, image, obj)
* easter eggs
* audio rendering (lol?!)
